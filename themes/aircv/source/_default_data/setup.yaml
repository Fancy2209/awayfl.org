  ## Setup

  AwayFL can be installed locally for your own use in a couple of different ways.

  ### 1. Embed script ###
  
  *Creates a simple, deployable html page for use with your own swfs.*
  
  Download **awayfl-embed** either as a [zip file](https://github.com/awayfl/awayfl-embed/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) or [Github project](https://github.com/awayfl/awayfl-embed)

  Use the following code (or copy/paste from the `example/index.html` file) to create a custom player for your swf file, ensuring embed.js points to the correct file:

  ``` html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en">
  <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
      <title>AwayFL Embed Example</title>
      <script src="../dist/embed.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
      <div id = 'container'>

      </div>

      <script>
          swfObject.embedSWF('Embedded.swf', 'container', 550, 400);
      </script>
  </body>
  </html>
  ```
  
  &nbsp;
   ### 2. Test template ###
  
  *Creates a self-contained project that runs as many swfs as you need, each with their own optional config settings.*

  Download **awayfl-template** either as a [zip file](https://github.com/awayfl/awayfl-template/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) or [Github template](https://github.com/awayfl/awayfl-template)

  Install by executing `npm install` in the terminal (requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs)) 

  Add various SWFs to your src/assets/ folder, and include the filnames in your `awayfl.config.js` file like so:

  ``` js
  fileconfigs: [
    {
        rt_title: "my Awesome Flash Game",
        rt_filename: "my_awesome_flash_game",
    },
  ],
  ```

  Run locally by executing `npm start` and browsing to `http://localhost`

  &nbsp;
  In both cases, more info can be found in the respective project's README files
